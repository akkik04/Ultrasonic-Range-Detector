# Ultrasonic-Range-Detector

This project aimed to test the accuracy of the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor. It used the 1602 LCD to display the distance. To better understand the HC-SR04 module, take a look at this [documentation](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf).

- ## **Main Components:**
Along with the three main components listed below, a solderless breadboard and jumper wires are required.

- ## **Functionality of the HC-SR04 module:**
- The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor utilizes ultrasonic sound to gauge the distance between itself and the closest solid object. The sensor's utility is not affected by dark material or sunlight. It has two fundamental constituents, a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter conveys a progression of ultrasonic pulses that reflect off the solid object and go back to the receiver. The time delay between the transmission and receiving process assists in finding the distance.
